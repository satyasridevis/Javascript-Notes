          <h1> Javascript Basics</h1>
         <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support. It is also one of the core technologies of the web
         JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>




          <!-- comment your JavaScript  code-->
  
         <h2>Comment your Javascript Code</h2>

        <p> There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript</p>
        <code>// - single line comment</code>
        <code> // this is an inline comment </code>
        <code>/* */ - multi-line comment</code>
        <code>/* This is  a multi-line comment</code>
      
      
  
<!-- Declaring JavaScript variables -->
    <h2>variables and Datatypes</h2>
    <h3>Declare JavaScript Variables </h3>
    <p> Number of datatypes :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Undefined</li>
          <li>Null</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>Strings</li>
          <li>Symbol</li>
          <li>bigint</li>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>Object</li>
        </ul>
             <p>to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword <strong>var</strong><br> Example:</p>
             <code> var myname; </code>
             <p>Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.</p>
             <p> storing values with the assignment operator</p>
             <code>
             var myvar;
             myvar = 10;
            </code>
      <h3>Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another</h3>
           
            <code>
              var myVar;
              myVar = 5;
              var myNum;
              myNum = myVar;
            </code>
           

     <h3>Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator</h3>
     <code> var myVar = 0;</code>
     <p>Understanding Uninitialized Variables <br>
     When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
     </p>

     <p>Increment operator</p>
     <code>
       i++;
       i=i+1;
     </code>
     <p>Decrement operator</p>
     <code>
      i--;
      i=i-1;
     </code>
     <p>decimal number</p>
    <code>var ourDecimal = 5.7;</code>
    <p>Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.</p>
    <code>var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;</code>
    <p>Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.</p>
    <code>var product = 2.0 * 2.5;</code>
    <p>Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
      The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

</p>

<code>
  5 % 2 = 1 because
  Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
  2 * 2 = 4
  5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

</code>

<p>Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.</p>
<code>
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
</code>

<p> Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.</p>
<code>
var remainder;
remainder= 11 % 3;
console.log(remainder);
</code>
<h3> Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division</h3>
<code>
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;
var d = 29;

a += 11; // Augmented Addition
b -= 9; // Augmented subtraction
c *= 3; // Augmented multiplication
d /=29; // Augmented division
</code>

<!-- Strings Declaration -->

<h2> Strings </h2>
<code> 
  var myName = "your name";
</code>
<p> "your name" is called a string literal</p>

<p>Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.</p>
<code>
  var myFirstName;
  var myLastName;
  myFirstName = "Satya";
  myLastName = "Sridevi";

  //Other way
  var myFirstName = "Satya";
  var myLastName = "Sridevi";

</code>

<h3> Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings</h3>
<p>
  When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?
  you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
</p>


<code>
var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
</code>
<p>Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

<br>I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".</p>

<code>
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
</code>
<h3>Quoting Strings with Single Quotes</h3>
<p>Single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript</p>
<code>
  doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string";
  singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
  conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"'; // works ok but there is a problem
  badStr = 'Finn responds, <span> "Let's</span> go!"'; // Throws an error
</code>

<h3>Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator</h3> 
<p>Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator</p>

<code>
var myStr="This is the start. " + "This is the end.";// This is the start. This is the end.
</code>
<h3>Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator</h3>

<code>
  var ourStr = "I come first. ";
  ourStr += "I come second.";
  // ourStr is now "I come first. I come second."
</code>

<h3>Constructing Strings with Variables</h3>
<code>
  var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
  var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
  // ourStr is now "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?"

</code>

<p>
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"
</p>
<code>
  var myName = "satya sridevi";
  var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
  // My name is satya sridevi and I am well!
</code>
<h3>Appending Variables to Strings</h3>
<code>
  var anAdjective = "awesome!";
  var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
  ourStr += anAdjective;
  // ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"
</code>

<p>Challenge: Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator</p>
<code>
  var someAdjective ="awesome";
  var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
  myStr += someAdjective;//Learning to code is awesome
</code>

<h3>Find the Length of a String </h3>
<p>You can find the length of a String value by (.length)</p> 
<p> Challenge: Use the (.length) property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength</p>
<code>
  var lastNameLength;
  var lastName = "Lovelace";
  lastNameLength = lastName.length;
  console.log(lastNameLength);// output : 8

</code>

<h3>Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String </h3>
<p> Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string. Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. <span> They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.</span></p> 
<code>
var firstName = "Charles";
var firstLetter = firstName[0]; // firstLetter is "C"
</code>
<p>Challenge: Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.</p>
<code>
  var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
  var lastName = "Lovelace";
  firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
  console.log(firstLetterOfLastName);// The Output is L
</code>

<h3> Understand String Immutability</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string</p>
<p>Challenge: Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World</p>
<code>
  var myStr = "Jello World";
  myStr = "Hello World";
  console.log(myStr); //The output is Hello World

</code>
<h3>Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String</h3>

<p>Challenge: Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.</p>
<code>
  var lastName = "Lovelace";
  var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
  console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName);// the Output is v
</code>

<h3>Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String </h3>>
</p>
<p>In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.</p>
<p>Challenge: Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="./img/javascriptarray1.jpg" alt="" class="javascriptarray1">
  <figcaption><p>Array Indexing</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<code>
  var lastName = "Lovelace";
  var lengthOfTheString = lastName.length;
  console.log(lengthOfTheString);// the output is 8
  var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
  console.log(lastLetterOfLastName);// The Output is e
</code>
<h3>Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String</h3>
<code>
  var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 3];
  console.log(lastLetterOfLastName);// The Output is a
</code>


<h3>Word Blanks</h3>
   <p>
    In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

    You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.
  
    You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.
   </p>
   
<code>
  var myNoun = "dog";
  var myAdjective = "big";
  var myVerb = "ran";
  var myAdverb = "quickly";
  var wordBlanks = myAdjective + " " + myNoun + " " + myVerb + " "+ myAdverb ;
  console.log(wordBlanks);
</code>

 <!-- Arrays section -->

<h2> Arrays</h2>
<p>Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays</p>
<p>With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.</p>
<code>
var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
</code>
<h3>Nest one Array within Another Array</h3>
<p>You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:</p>
<code>
var myArray = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
</code>
<h3>Access Array Data with Indexes</h3>
<p> We can access the data inside arrays using indexes. ike strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.</p>

<code>
  Example:
  var array = [50,60,70];
  array[0]; // equals 50
  var data = array[1];  // equals 60
</code>

<p>Challenge: Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.</p>
<code>
var myArray = [50,60,70];
var myData = myArray[0];
console.log(myData);
</code>


<h3>Modify Array Data With Indexes</h3>
<p>Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.</p>
<code>
  var ourArray = [50,40,30];
  ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
</code>

<p>Challenge: Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.</p>

<code>
var myArray = [18,64,99];
myArray[0] = 45;
console.log(myArray);
</code>

<h3>Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes</h3>

<code>
Example
var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11

</code>
<p>Challenge: Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.</p>
<code>
  var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];
  var myData = myArray[2][1];
  console.log(myData);
</code>

<h3>Manipulate Arrays With push()</h3>
<p>
  An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.
(.push()) takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
</p>
<code>
  Example
  var arr1 = [1,2,3];
 arr1.push(4);
 // arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]
 var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
 arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
 // arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]];
</code>
<p>Challenge : Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.</p>
<code>
  var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
  myArray.push(["dog",3]);
  console.log(myArray); [ [ 'John', 23 ], [ 'cat', 2 ], [ 'dog', 3 ] ]
</code>
<h4> Manipulate Arrays With pop()</h4>
<p>Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.(.pop()) is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.</p>
<code>
  var threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
  var oneDown = threeArr.pop();
  console.log(oneDown); // Returns 6
  console.log(threeArr); // Returns [1, 4]
</code>

<p> Challenge: Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray, assigning the "popped off" value to removedFromMyArray.</p>
<code>
  var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
  var removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop();
  console.log(removedFromMyArray);
  console.log(myArray);
</code>

<h3> Manipulate Arrays With shift()</h3>
<p>pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.  </p>
<code>
Example: var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
// removedFromOurArray now equals "Stimpson" and ourArray now equals ["J", ["cat"]].
</code>
<p>Challenge: Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray, assigning the "shifted off" value to removedFromMyArray.
</p>
<code>
  var myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
  var removedFromMyArray = myArray.shift();
  console.log(removedFromMyArray);
</code>
<h3>Manipulate Arrays With unshift()</h3>
<p>Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

(.unshift()) works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.</p>

 <code>
   var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
   ourArray.shift(); // ourArray now equals ["J", "cat"]
   ourArray.unshift("Happy");
   // ourArray now equals ["Happy", "J", "cat"]
 </code>

 <p>Challenge: Add ["Paul",35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().</p>
<code>
 var myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
 myArray.shift();
 myArray.unshift(["Paul",35]);
</code>

<h3>Shopping List</h3>
<p>Challenge: Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.</p>

<p>The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.</p> 
<p>["Chocolate Bar", 15]</p>
<p>There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.</p>

<code>
  var myList = [["candy",10], ["Ice Cream", 3],
  ["Biscuits", 20], ["lollipops", 5], ["jelly", 1]];
  console.log(myList);
</code>
 
 <!-- functions -->
<h2>Functions</h2>
<h3>Write reusable javascript using functions. </h3>
<p>In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions</p>
 <code>
   function functionName()
   {
  console.log("Hello World");
   }

 </code>
 <p>You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: <span>functionName(); </span> Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.</p>
 <p>Challenges:  Create a function called reusableFunction which prints "Hi World" to the dev console.Call the function</p>
     <code>
       function reusableFunction()
     {
        console.log("Hi World");
     }
       reusableFunction();
    </code>

<h3>Passing Values to Functions with Arguments</h3>
<p>Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.</p>
<p>Challenge: Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.Call the function with two numbers as arguments.
</p>
<code>
  function functionWithArgs(a,b)
  {
    var c = a + b;
    console.log(c);
  }
  functionWithArgs(10,10);
</code>

<h3>Global scope and Functions</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Challenge: Using var, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10. Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var keyword.</p>

<code>
  var myGlobal =10;
  function fun1()
  {
  oopsGlobal = 5;
  }

  function fun2()
  {
    var output = "";
    if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }

    if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined")
    {
      output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
    }
    console.log(output);
  }
</code>


<h3>Local Scope and Functions</h3>

<p>
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.
</p>

<code>
  function myLocalScope() 
  {
    'use strict';
     var myVar;// undefined
     console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
  }
  myLocalScope();// function called. output will be "inside myLocalScope undefined"
  console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);// myVar called outside the function
  // because myVar is local variable.
 </code>
 <h3>Global vs. Local Scope in Functions</h3>
 <p>It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.</p>


  <code>
    var outerWear = "T-Shirt";
    function myOutfit()
    {
      var outerWear = "sweater";
      return outerWear;
    }
    myOutfit();
  </code>

<h3>Return a Value from a Function with Return</h3>
<p>We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.</p>
<code>
  function plusThree(num)
  {
    return num + 3;
  }
  var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
</code>
<p>Challenge: Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value. See the last line in the editor for an example of how you can test your timesFive function.</p>
<code>
  function timesFive(a)
  {
     return a * 5;
  }
  timesFive(5);
</code>

<h3>Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function</h3>
<p>A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.</p>
<code>
  var sum = 0;
  function addSum(num)
  {
    sum = sum + num;
  }
  addSum(3);
</code>

<p>Challenge: Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.</p>
<code>
  var sum = 0;

  function addThree()
  {
    sum = sum + 3;
  }

  function addFive()
  {
    sum = sum + 5;
  }
  addThree();
  addFive();
</code>

<p>Assignment with a Returned Value</p>
<p>If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.</p>
<p>challenge: Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.</p>
<code>
  var processed = 0;
  function processArg(num)
  {
    return (num + 3) / 5;
  }
  processed = processArg(7);
</code>

<h3>Challenge: Stand In Line</h3>
<p>In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.
  Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.
  Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.
  The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.</p>

<code>
  function nextInLine(arr, item)
  {
     arr.push(item); //pushes 7 end of the array
     var removed = arr.shift(); remove the first item of the array
     return removed;
     return item;
  }
  var testArr = [1,2,3,4,5];
  console.log("Before: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
  console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 7));// arr -> testArr and 7 -> item to push
  console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
</code>

<!--IF else Conditional statement-->
<h2>Boolean and conditional statements</h2>
<h3>Understanding Boolean Values</h3>
<p>Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive</p>
<p>Challenge: Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.</p>
<code>
  function welcomeToBooleans()
  {
   return true;
  }
</code>
<h3> Use Conditional Logic with If Statements</h3>
<p>If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false. When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.</p>

<code>
  function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) 
  {
    if (wasThatTrue)
    {
      return "Yes, that was true";
    }
      return "No, that was false";
  }
</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Equality Operator</h3>
<p>There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.</p>
<p>n order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as "Type Coercion</p>

<code>
  1   ==  1   // true
  1   ==  2   // false
  1   == '1'  // true
  "3" ==  3   // true

</code>

<p>Challenge: Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when val is equivalent to 12.</p>
<code>
  function testEqual(val) 
  {
    if (val == 12) {
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  testEqual(10);
</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator</h3>
<p>Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.</p>
<code>
  3 ===  3   // true
  3 === '3'  // false
</code>

<p>Challenge: Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return "Equal" when val is strictly equal to 7</p>
<code>
  function testStrict(val) {
    if (val === 7)
    {
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
testStrict(10);
</code>

<h3>Practice comparing different values</h3>
<code>
  function compareEquality(a, b) 
  {
    if (a === b) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  compareEquality(10, "10");

</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Inequality Operator</h3>
<p>The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.</p>
<code>
  1 !=  2     // true
  1 != "1"    // false
  1 != '1'    // false
  1 != true   // false
  0 != false  // false

</code>
<p>challenge: Add the inequality operator != in the if statement so that the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not equivalent to 99</p>

<code>
  function testNotEqual(val) {
    if (val != 99) { // Change this line
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    return "Equal";
  }
   testNotEqual(10);
</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator</h3>
<p>The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.</p>
<code>
  3 !==  3   // false
  3 !== '3'  // true
  4 !==  3   // true
</code>
<p>Challenge: Add the strict inequality operator to the if statement so the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not strictly equal to 17
</p>
<code>
  function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
    if (val !== 17) { // Change this line
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    return "Equal";
  }

  testStrictNotEqual(10);

</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Greater Than Operator </h3>
<p>The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.</p>
<code>
  function testGreaterThan(val) 
  {
  if (val > 100) {
    return "Over 100";
  }
  if (val > 10) {
    return "Over 10";
  }
  return "10 or Under";
  }

testGreaterThan(10);
</code>

<h4>Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator</h4>
<p>The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.</p>
<code>
6   >=  6   // true
7   >= '3'  // true
2   >=  3   // false
'7' >=  9   // false
</code>

<p>challenges : Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.</p>
<code>
  function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
    if (val >= 20) {
      return "20 or Over";
    }

    if (val >= 10) {
      return "10 or Over";
    }

    return "Less than 10";
  }

  testGreaterOrEqual(10);


</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Less Than Operator</h3>
<p>The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.</p>
<code>
  2 < 5  // true
 '3'< 7  // true
  5 < 5  // false
  3 < 2  // false
 '8'< 4  // false
</code>

<p>challenge:</p>

<code>
  function testLessThan(val) 
  {
    if (val < 25) 
    { 
    return "Under 25";
    }
    if (val < 55) 
    {  
      return "Under 55";
    }
    return "55 or Over";
  }
   testLessThan(10);
</code>

<h3>Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator</h3>
<p>The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than or equal to converts data types.</p>
<code>
  4 <= 5  // true
 '7'<= 7  // true
  5 <= 5  // true
  3 <= 2  // false
 '8'<= 4  // false
</code>

<code>
  function testLessOrEqual(val) 
  {
    if (val<=12) 
    {
      return "Smaller Than or Equal to 12";
    }

    if (val<=24) 
    {
      return "Smaller Than or Equal to 24";
    }

    return "More Than 24";
  }

  testLessOrEqual(10);

</code>

<h3>Comparisons with the Logical And Operator</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.  <br> Example code </p>
<code>
  if (num > 5 && num < 10) 
  {
    return "Yes";
  }
  return "No";

</code>

<p>Challenge:Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the && operator, which will return "Yes" if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return "No".
 </p>

 <code>
   function testLogicalAnd(val) 
   {
   if(val <= 50 && val >= 25)
     {
      return "Yes";
     } 
    return "No";
   }
   testLogicalAnd(10);
</code>
<h3>Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator </h3>
<p>The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.</p>
<p>Challenge: Combine the two if statements into one statement which returns "Outside" if val is not between 10 and 20, inclusive. Otherwise, return "Inside"</p>

<code>
  function testLogicalOr(val) 
  {
   if (val<10 || val>20) 
     {
      return "Outside";
     }
     return "Inside";
  }
  testLogicalOr(15)

</code>
<h3>Introducing Else Statements</h3>
<p>When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.</p>
<p>Challenge: Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.</p>
<code>
  function testElse(val) 
  {
    var result = "";
   if (val>5 && val>=5) 
   {
      return "Bigger than 5";
    }
   else 
   {
      return "5 or Smaller";
    }
   return result;
  }
  testElse(10);

</code>

<h3>Introducing Else If Statements</h3>
<p>If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.</p>
<code>
  if(num > 15) 
  {
    return "Bigger than 15";
  } 
  else if(num < 5) 
  {
    return "Smaller than 5";
  } else {
    return "Between 5 and 15";
  }
</code>

<p>challenge: Convert the logic to use else if statements</p>
<code>
  function testElseIf(val) 
  {
    if (val > 10) {
      return "Greater than 10";
    }
    else if(val < 5) 
    {
      return "Smaller than 5";
    }
   else
   {
    return "Between 5 and 10";
   }
  testElseIf(7);
  }
</code>

<h3>Logical Order in If Else Statements</h3>
<p>Order is important in if, else if statements.The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.</p>
<code>
  function orderMyLogic(val) 
  {
    if (val < 5) {
      return  "Less than 5";
    } else if (val < 10) {
      return "Less than 10";
    } else {
      return "Greater than or equal to 10";
    }
  }

  orderMyLogic(4);
  orderMyLogic(6);
  orderMyLogic(11);
</code>

<h3>Chaining If Else Statements</h3>
<p>if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic. Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:</p>
<code>
  if (condition1) 
  {
  statement1
  } 
  else if (condition2) 
  {
  statement2
  } 
 if (condition3) 
 {
  statement3
. . .
 } 
 else 
 {
  statementN
 }

</code>

<p>Write chained if/else if statements to fulfill the following conditions:

num < 5 - return "Tiny"
num < 10 - return "Small"
num < 15 - return "Medium"
num < 20 - return "Large"
num >= 20 - return "Huge"</p>

<code>
  function testSize(num) 
  {
    
    if(num < 5)
    {
      return "Tiny";
    }
    else if(num < 10)
    {
      return "Small";
    }
    else if (num < 15)
    {
      return "Medium";
    }
      else if (num < 20)
    {
      return "Large";
    }

     else if (num >= 20)
    {
      return "Huge";
    }
  else
  {
     return "Change Me";
  }

  }

  testSize(0);
  testSize(4);
  testSize(5);
  testSize(8);
  testSize(10);
  testSize(14);
  testSize(15);
  testSize(17);
  testSize(20);
  testSize(25);


</code>
<h3>Golf Code</h3>
<p>In the game of golf each hole has a par meaning the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in a hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):</p>
<code>
Strokes	    Return
1	          "Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	    "Birdie"
par	        "Par"
par + 1	    "Bogey"
par + 2	    "Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!
</code>

<code>
  var names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];
  function golfScore(par, strokes) {

  if (strokes === 1 )
  {
    return "Hole-in-one!";
  }
  else if(strokes <= (par - 2))
  {
    return "Eagle";
  }
  else if(strokes === (par - 1))
  {
    return "Birdie";
  }
  else if(strokes === par)
  {
    return "Par";
  }
  else if(strokes === (par + 1))
  {
     return "Bogey";
  }

  else if(strokes === (par + 2))
  {
    return "Double Bogey";
  }

  else if(strokes >= (par + 3))
  {
    return "Go Home!";
  }
  return "Change Me";
  }

  golfScore(4, 1);
  golfScore(4, 2);
  golfScore(5, 2);
  golfScore(4, 3);
  golfScore(4, 4);
  golfScore(1, 1);
  golfScore(5, 5);
  golfScore(4, 5);
  golfScore(4, 6);
  golfScore(4, 7);
  golfScore(5, 9);


</code>

<h2>Switch Case</h2>
<h3>Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements</h3>
<p>If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.Here is an example of a switch statement</p>
<code>
  switch(lowercaseLetter) 
  {
    case "a":
      console.log("A");
      break;
    case "b":
      console.log("B");
      break;
  }
</code>
<p>case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.</p>
<p>challenge : Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
 1 - "alpha"
 2 - "beta"
 3 - "gamma"
 4 - "delta"</p>
<code>
  function caseInSwitch(val)
   {
    var answer = "";
    switch(val)
    {
      case 1:
      return "alpha";
      break;
      case 2:
      return "beta";
      break;
      case 3:
      return "gamma";
      break;
      case 4:
      return "delta";
      break;
  }
  return answer;
  }
  caseInSwitch(1);
  caseInSwitch(2);
  caseInSwitch(3);
  caseInSwitch(4);

</code>
<h3>Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements</h3>
<p>In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.</p>
<code>
  switch (num) 
  {
    case value1:
      statement1;
      break;
    case value2:
      statement2;
      break;
  ...
    default:
      defaultStatement;
      break;
  }
</code>

<p>challenge: Write a switch statement to set answer for the following conditions:
"a" - "apple"
"b" - "bird"
"c" - "cat"
default - "stuff"
</p>

<code>
  function switchOfStuff(val) 
  {
    var answer = "";
    // Only change code below this line
    switch(val)
  {
    case "a":
    return "apple";
    break;
    case "b":
    return "bird";
    break;
    case "c":
    return "cat";
    break;

    default:
    return "stuff";
    break;

  }
  return answer;
  }

  switchOfStuff(1);
</code>
<h3>Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements</h3>
<p>If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like</p>
<code>
  switch(val) 
  {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      result = "1, 2, or 3";
      break;
    case 4:
      result = "4 alone";
  }
</code>
<p>Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.</p>
<p>
Challenge: Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:
1-3 - "Low"
4-6 - "Mid"
7-9 - "High"
</p>
<code>
  function sequentialSizes(val) 
  {
    var answer = "";
    switch(val)
    {
      case 1:
      case 2:
      case 3:
      return "Low";
      break;
      case 4:
      case 5:
      case 6:
      return "Mid";
      break;
      case 7:
      case 8:
      case 9:
      return "High";
      break;


    }
  return answer;
  }

  sequentialSizes(1);
  sequentialSizes(2);
  sequentialSizes(3);
  sequentialSizes(4);
  sequentialSizes(5);
  sequentialSizes(6);
  sequentialSizes(7);
  sequentialSizes(8);
  sequentialSizes(9);


</code>
<h3> Replacing If Else Chains with Switch</h3> 
<p>If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:</p>
<code>
  if (val === 1)
   {
  answer = "a";
   } 
  else if (val === 2) 
  {
  answer = "b";
  }  
 else 
 {
  answer = "c";
 }
</code>
<code>
  switch(val) 
  {
    case 1:
      answer = "a";
      break;
    case 2:
      answer = "b";
      break;
    default:
      answer = "c";
  }

</code>
<p>challenge</p>
<code>
  function chainToSwitch(val) 
  {
    var answer = "";
    switch(val)
     {
       case "bob":
       answer = "Marley";
       break;
       case 42:
       answer = "The Answer";
       break;
       case 1:
       answer = "There is no #1";
       break;
       case 99:
       answer = "Missed me by this much!";
       break;
       case 7:
       answer = "Ate Nine";
  }
    return answer;
  }
  chainToSwitch(7);
  chainToSwitch("bob");
  chainToSwitch(42);
  chainToSwitch(1);
  chainToSwitch(99);
  chainToSwitch(7);
  chainToSwitch("john");
  chainToSwitch(156);

</code>

<h3>Returning Boolean Values from Functions</h3>
<p>You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.</p>
<p>Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:</p>
<code>
  function isEqual(a,b) 
  {
  if (a === b) 
  {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
</code>
<p>But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:</p>
<code>
  function isEqual(a,b) {
    return a === b;
  }
</code>
<p>challenge</p>

<code>
  function isLess(a, b)
  {
    if (a < b) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  isLess(10, 15);

  ////////////////////////////////////////

  function isLess(a, b)
  {
    return a < b;
  }

isLess(10, 15);
</code>

<h3>Return Early Pattern for Functions</h3>
  <p>When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.</p>
  <code>
    function myFun()
    {
   console.log("Hello");
   return "World";
   console.log("byebye")
    }
   myFun();
  </code>
  <p>Challenge: Modify the function abTest so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with a value of undefined.</p>
  <code>
  function abTest(a, b) 
   {
   if (a < 0 || b < 0)
   {
   return undefined;
   }
   return Math.round(Math.pow(Math.sqrt(a) + Math.sqrt(b), 2));
   }
 abTest(2,2);
</code>
  <h3>Counting Cards</h3>
  <p>In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.
Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.</p>
<p>You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.</p>
 <code>
   var count = 0;
   function cc(card)
  {
  switch(card)
   {
     case 2:
     case 3:
     case 4:
     case 5:
     case 6:
     count++;
     break;
     case 10:
     case 'J':
     case 'Q':
     case 'K':
     case 'A':
     count--;
     break;
   }

   if (count > 0)
   {
      return count + " Bet";
   }
   else
    {
      return  count + " Hold";
    }
    return "Change Me";

  }

  cc(10); cc('J'); cc('Q'); cc('K'); cc('A');


 </code>
 <h2>Objects</h2>
 <h3>Build JavaScript Objects</h3>
 <p>You may have heard the term object before.
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.</p>
<code>
  var cat = 
  {
    "name": "Whiskers",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
  };

</code>
<p>In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails". However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:</p>
<code>
  var anotherObject = 
  {
    make: "Ford",
    5: "five",
    "model": "focus"
  };

</code>
<p>However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.</p>

<h3>Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation</h3>
<p>There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.
Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.
Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:</p>
<code>
  var myObj = {
    prop1: "val1",
    prop2: "val2"
  };
  var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
  var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2

</code>
<p>Challenge: Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.</p>
<code>
  var testObj = {
    "hat": "ballcap",
    "shirt": "jersey",
    "shoes": "cleats"
  };
  var hatValue = testObj.hat;
  var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;

</code>

<h3>Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation</h3>
<p>The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.
Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:</p>
<code>
  var myObj = 
  {
    "Space Name": "Kirk",
    "More Space": "Spock",
    "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
  };
  myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
  myObj['More Space']; // Spock
  myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
</code>
<p>challenge: Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.</p>
<code>
  var testObj = {
    "an entree": "hamburger",
    "my side": "veggies",
    "the drink": "water"
  };
  var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];
  var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];
</code>
<h3>Accessing Object Properties with Variables</h3>
<p>Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:</p>
<code>
  var dogs = {
    Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
  };
  var myDog = "Hunter";
  var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
  console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"

<h4>Accessing Object Properties with Variables</h4>
<p>Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:</p>

  };
  var myDog = "Hunter";
  var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
  console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
</code>
<p>Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:</p>
<code>
  var someObj = {
    propName: "John"
  };
  function propPrefix(str) {
    var s = "prop";
    return s + str;
  }
  var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
  console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"

</code>
<p>challenge: Set the playerNumber variable to 16. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to player.</p>
<code>
  var testObj = {
    12: "Namath",
    16: "Montana",
    19: "Unitas"
  };
  var playerNumber = 16;
  var player = testObj[playerNumber];
  console.log(player);
</code>
<h3>Updating Object Properties</h3>
<p>After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.</p>
<p>For example, let's look at ourDog</p>
<code>
  var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["everything!"]
  };
</code>
<p>Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper". Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper"</p>
<p>challenge: Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from "Coder" to "Happy Coder". You can use either dot or bracket notation.</p>
<code>
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
  };
  myDog.name = "Happy Coder";
  console.log(myDog.name);

</code>

<h3>Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object</h3>
<p>You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".</p>

<code>
  var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["everything!"]
  };

  ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

</code>
<p>Challenge: Add a "bark" property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation</p>
<code>
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Happy Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
  };
 myDog.bark ="woof"

  console.log(myDog);

</code>

<h3>Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object</h3>

<p>We can also delete properties from objects like this: delete ourDog.bark;</p>
<code>
  var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["everything!"],
    "bark": "bow-wow"
  };

  delete ourDog.bark;
</code>
<p>challenge: Delete the "tails" property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.</p>
<code>
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Happy Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
    "bark": "woof"
  };
  delete myDog["tails"];
  console.log(myDog);

</code>
<h3>Using Objects for Lookups</h3>
<p>Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:</p>
<code>
  var alpha = {
    1:"Z",
    2:"Y",
    3:"X",
    4:"W",
    ...
    24:"C",
    25:"B",
    26:"A"
  };
  alpha[2]; // "Y"
  alpha[24]; // "C"
</code>
<p>challenge:Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.</p>
<code>
  function phoneticLookup(val) {
    var result = "";
    var lookup = {
      "alpha":"Adams",

      "bravo":"Boston",

      "charlie":"Chicago",

      "delta":"Denver",

      "echo":"Easy",

       "foxtrot":"Frank"
    };

    result = lookup[val];
    return result;
  }

  phoneticLookupTesting Objects for Properties("charlie");
</code>

<h3>Testing Objects for Properties</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.</p>
<code>
  var myObj = {
    top: "hat",
    bottom: "pants"
  };
  myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");    // true
  myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false

</code>
<p>challenge: Modify the function checkObj to test if an object passed to the function (obj) contains a specific property (checkProp). If the property is found, return that property's value. If not, return "Not Found".</p>
<code>
  function checkObj(obj, checkProp) 
  {

    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp))
    {
      return obj[checkProp];
    }
    else
    {
      return "Not Found";
    }
   }
  checkObj({gift: "pony", pet: "kitten", bed: "sleigh"}, "gift")
  checkObj({gift: "pony", pet: "kitten", bed: "sleigh"}, "pet")
  checkObj({gift: "pony", pet: "kitten", bed: "sleigh"}, "house")

</code>

<h3>Manipulating Complex Objects</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure</p>
<code>
  var ourMusic = [
    {
      "artist": "Daft Punk",
      "title": "Homework",
      "release_year": 1997,
      "formats": [
        "CD",
        "Cassette",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
    }
  ];

</code>
<p>This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a value of "Daft Punk". JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data.</p>

<code>
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "Cassette",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
</code>
<p>challenge: Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.</p>
<code>
  var myMusic = [
    {
      "artist": "Billy Joel",
      "title": "Piano Man",
      "release_year": 1973,
      "formats": [
        "CD",
        "8T",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
    }
    // Add a record here
  ,

  {
     "artist": "Miley Cyrus",
      "title": "Party in USA",
      "release_year": 2009,
      "formats": [
        "CD",
        "8T",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
  }
];

</code>
<h3>Accessing Nested Objects</h3>
<p>The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.</p>
<code>
  var ourStorage = {
    "desk": {
      "drawer": "stapler"
    },
    "cabinet": {
      "top drawer": {
        "folder1": "a file",
        "folder2": "secrets"
      },
      "bottom drawer": "soda"
    }
  };
  ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;  // "secrets"
  ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"
</code>

<p>challenge: Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket notation.</p>
<code>
  var myStorage = {
    "car": {
      "inside": {
        "glove box": "maps",
        "passenger seat": "crumbs"
       },
      "outside": {
        "trunk": "jack"
      }
    }
  };

  var gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside["glove box"]; // Change this line
  console.log(gloveBoxContents);
</code>
<h3>Accessing Nested Arrays</h3>
<p>As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, Array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:</p>
<code>
  var ourPets = [
    {
      animalType: "cat",
      names: [
        "Meowzer",
        "Fluffy",
        "Kit-Cat"
      ]
    },
    {
      animalType: "dog",
      names: [
        "Spot",
        "Bowser",
        "Frankie"
      ]
    }
  ];
  ourPets[0].names[1]; // "Fluffy"
  ourPets[1].names[0]; // "Spot"
</code>

<p>Challenge: Retrieve the second tree from the variable myPlants using object dot and array bracket notation.</p>
<code>
  // Setup
  var myPlants = [
    {
      type: "flowers",
      list: [
        "rose",
        "tulip",
        "dandelion"
      ]
    },
    {
      type: "trees",
      list: [
        "fir",
        "pine",
        "birch"
      ]
    }
  ];
  var secondTree = myPlants[1].list[1];
  console.log(secondTree);


</code>


<h3>Record Collection</h3>
<p>You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.
  You start with an updateRecords function that takes an object like collection, an id, a prop (like artist or tracks), and a value. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.</p>
  
  <p>Your function must always return the entire object.</p>

  <ul>
   <li>If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.</li>
   <li> If prop is tracks but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.</li>
   <li>If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.</li>
   <li>If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album</li> 
   </ul>
   
<code>
    var collection = {
      2548: {
        albumTitle: 'Slippery When Wet',
        artist: 'Bon Jovi',
        tracks: ['Let It Rock', 'You Give Love a Bad Name']
      },
      2468: {
        albumTitle: '1999',
        artist: 'Prince',
        tracks: ['1999', 'Little Red Corvette']
      },
      1245: {
        artist: 'Robert Palmer',
        tracks: []
      },
      5439: {
        albumTitle: 'ABBA Gold'
      }
    };
    
    // Only change code below this line
    function updateRecords(object, id, prop, value) {
      if (value === '') delete object[id][prop];
      else if (prop === 'tracks') {
        object[id][prop] = object[id][prop] || [];
        object[id][prop].push(value);
      } else {
        object[id][prop] = value;
      }
    
      return object;
    }

  </code>

  <code>
    /// alterative code///
    if(prop !== 'tracks' && value !== "") 
    {
      collection[id][prop] = value;
    }
    
    if(prop === 'tracks' && collection[id][prop] === undefined) 
    {
      collection[id][prop] = [];
    }
    
    if(prop === 'tracks') {
      let track = collection[id][prop];
      track.push(value)
    }
    
    if(value === "") {
      delete collection[id][prop]
    }

  </code>
  
<h2>Loops</h2>
<h3> Iterate with JavaScript While Loop</h3>
<p>
  You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop. The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
</p>

<p> During this section. I learnt how the code executes line by line. look at the second code snippet. Output should be [5,4,3,2,1,0]. My output was [4,3,2,1,0]. I was confused during this challenge,then i found where to place console.log() to print to correct output. i place console.log(i) below the i-- my output was [4,3,2,1,0]. it didn't read i = 5. placed inbetween myArray.push[i] and i--. i had the expected output to complete the challenge.   </p>

<code>
   var ourArray = [];
   var i = 0;
   while(i < 5) 
   {
   ourArray.push(i);
   i++;
   console.log(i);
   }

   output: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
</code>

<p>challenge</p>
<code>

  var myArray = [];
  var i = 5;
  while(i >= 0) 
  {
  myArray.push(i);
  i--;
  }

  Output: [5,4,3,2,1,0]
</code>


<h3>Iterate with javascript For Loops</h3>
<p>
  You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs "for" a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final-expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final-expression.
</p>

<code>
  var ourArray = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
  {
  ourArray.push(i);
  }
</code>
<p>Challenge: Use a for loop to work to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.</p>
<code>
      var myArray = [];
      for(var i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
      {
      console.log(i);
      myArray.push(i);
      }
      
      output: [1,2,3,4,5]
  </code>
  <h3>Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop</h3>
  <p>or loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.
    We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.</p>
    <code>
      var ourArray = [];
      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) 
      {
      ourArray.push(i);
      }
    </code>
    <p>Challenge: Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.</p>
    <code>
      var myArray = [];
      for(var i = 1; i < 10; i += 2)
      {
          myArray.push(i);
          console.log(i);
      }

    </code>
    <h3>Count backwards with a for loop</h3>
    <p>A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.

      In order to count backwards by twos, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final-expression.
      
      We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.</p>
      <code>
        var ourArray = [];
        for (var i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) 
        {
          ourArray.push(i);
        }
        output: [10,8,6,4,2]
       </code>

      <p>Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.</p>

      <code>
        var myArray = [];
        for(var i = 9; i > 0; i-=2)
        {
         console.log(i);
         myArray.push(i);
        }
        output: [9,7,5,3,1] 
      </code>

      <h3>Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop</h3>
      <p>A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:</p>
       <code>
        var arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];
        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) 
        {
           console.log(arr[i]);
        }
       </code>
       <p>
        Remember that arrays have zero-based indexing, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops the loop when i is equal to length. In this case the last iteration is i === 4 i.e. when i becomes equal to arr.length and outputs 6 to the console.
       </p>
        <p>Challenge: Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total.</p>
          <code>
              var myArr = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
              var total = 0;
              for(var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++)
              {
               total += myArr[i];
                console.log(total);
              }

            </code>
            <h3>Nesting For Loops</h3>
            <p>If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example</p>
             <code>
              var arr = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]];
              for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) 
              {
              for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) 
              {
                console.log(arr[i][j]);
              }
              }
             </code>
             <p>
              Modify function multiplyAll so that it returns the product of all the numbers in the sub-arrays of arr.
             </p>
  <code>
    function multiplyAll(arr) 
    {
       var product = 1;
       for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) 
       {
          for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) 
          {
            product *= arr[i][j];
            console.log(product);
          }
        }
        return product;
      }
      multiplyAll([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6,7]]);
      multiplyAll([[1],[2],[3]]);
      multiplyAll([[5,1],[0.2, 4, 0.5],[3, 9]]);
  </code>
             <h3> Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops</h3>
             <p>The next type of loop you will learn is called a do...while loop. It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.</p>
  <code>
    var ourArray = [];
    var i = 0;
    do {
        ourArray.push(i);
        i++;

       output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  </code>

  <code>
    var ourArray = []; 
    var i = 5;
    while (i < 5) 
    {
    ourArray.push(i);
    i++;
    } 
  </code>
  <code>
    var ourArray = []; 
    var i = 5;
    do {
        ourArray.push(i);
        i++;
    } while (i < 5);

<p>challenge Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.</p>
  <code>
    var myArray = [];
    var i = 10;
    do  {
      myArray.push(i);
      i++;
      console.log(i);
    }while (i < 5);

<h3>Replace loops using Recursion</h3>
  <p>Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements. Using a for loop, you could do this:</p>
  <code>
    function multiply(arr, n) {
      var product = 1;
      for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) 
      {
          product *= arr[i];// product = product * arr[i];
      }
      return product;
      }
    </code>
<p>However, notice that multiply(arr, n) == multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1]. That means you can rewrite multiply in terms of itself and never need to use a loop.</p>
<code>
function multiply(arr, n) 
{
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
  }
}        
</code>  
        <p>The recursive version of multiply breaks down like this. In the base case, where n <= 0, it returns 1. For larger values of n, it calls itself, but with n - 1. That function call is evaluated in the same way, calling multiply again until n <= 0. At this point, all the functions can return and the original multiply returns the answer.</p> 
        <p>Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.</p>         
        <p>Challenge: Write a recursive function, sum(arr, n), that returns the sum of the first n elements of an array arr.</p>
        <code>
          function sum(arr, n) {
            
          if(n <= 0)
          {
            return 0;
          }
          else 
          {
            return sum(arr, n-1) + arr[n-1];
          }
            
          }
          
          sum([1], 0);
          sum([2, 3, 4], 1);
          sum([2, 3, 4, 5], 3);

<h3>Profile Lookup</h3>
  <p>We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.
    The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.
    If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.
    If name does not correspond to any contacts then return "No such contact".
    If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return "No such property".</p>

     <h2>Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.</h2>
      <p>JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1</p>
      <p>Like Storing Values with the Equal Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function</p>
      <p>Challenge : change randomFraction to return  random number instead of returning 0</p>
      <code>
      function randomFraction() 
       {
            return Math.random();// all function calls will be resolved before the return executes
       }

      <h2>Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript</h2>
      <p>It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.</li>
         <li>Multiply that random decimal by 20.</li>
         <li>Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.</p>
       <p>Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:</p>
       <p>Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);</p>
       <p>We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.</p>
       <p>Challenge : Use this technique to generate and return a random whole number between 0 and 9</p>
       <code>
        function randomWholeNum() 
        {
           return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
        }
       </code>

      <h2>Use the parseInt Function</h2>
      <p>The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer.</p>
      <p>example: var a = parseInt("007");The above function converts the string "007" to an integer 7. If the first character in the string can't be converted into a number, then it returns NaN.</p>
      <p>challenge: Use parseInt() in the convertToInteger function so it converts the input string str into an integer, and returns it.</p>

<h2>Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator </h2>
<p>The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.
The syntax is:condition ? expression-if-true : expression-if-false;</p>
 <code>
  function findGreater(a, b) 
  {
    if(a > b) 
    {
      return "a is greater";
    }
   else 
    {
    return "b is greater";
    }
    }
    </code>
<code>
  function findGreater(a, b) 
    {
      return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
    }
  </code>
            
  <p>Challenge: Use the conditional operator in the checkEqual function to check if two numbers are equal or not. The function should return either "Equal" or "Not Equal".</p>
  <code>
    function checkEqual(a, b) 
    {
        return a === b ? "Equal" : "Not Equal";
    }
    checkEqual(1, 2);                       
  </code>
<h2>Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators</h2>
<code>
  function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) 
  {
    if (a === b) 
    {
      return "a and b are equal";
    }
    
    else if (a > b) {
      return "a is greater";
    }
    else {
      return "b is greater";
    }
  }
  </code>
  <code>
  function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) 
    {
    return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
    }
  </code>
<p>Challenge: In the checkSign function, use multiple conditional operators - following the recommended format used in findGreaterOrEqual - to check if a number is positive, negative or zero. The function should return "positive", "negative" or "zero".</p>
<code>
  function checkSign(num) 
  {
  return (num>0) ? "positive" : (num<0) ? "negative" : "zero";
  }
  checkSign(10);         
  checkSign(-12);
</code>
       
 <h2>Use Recursion to Create a Countdown</h2>
 <p>In a previous challenge, you learned how to use recursion to replace a for loop. Now, let's look at a more complex function that returns an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.</p>
 <p>As mentioned in the previous challenge, there will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known. There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.</p>
 <p>For example, say you want to write a recursive function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 through n. This function will need to accept an argument, n, representing the final number. Then it will need to call itself with progressively smaller values of n until it reaches 1. You could write the function as follows:</p>  
<code>
  function countup(n) {
    if (n < 1) {
      return [];
    } else {
      const countArray = countup(n - 1);
      countArray.push(n);
      return countArray;
    }
  }
  console.log(countup(5));  
</code>

<p>The value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will be displayed in the console.</p>
<p>At first, this seems counterintuitive since the value of n decreases, but the values in the final array are increasing. This happens because the push happens last, after the recursive call has returned. At the point where n is pushed into the array, countup(n - 1) has already been evaluated and returned [1, 2, ..., n - 1].</p>     
<p>CHALLENGE: We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter. If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.</p>       
<h2>
  Use Recursion to Create a Range of NumbersPassed
</h2>    

<p>Continuing from the previous challenge, we provide you another opportunity to create a recursive function to solve a problem</p>
<p>CHALLENGE: We have defined a function named rangeOfNumbers with two parameters. The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter. The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.</p>

<!--ES6 features section-->
<section id="ecmascriptsix">
  <h1>ES6 Features</h1>
  <h2>Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.</p>
  <code>
var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
  </code>
  <p>Here the console will display the string David.</p>
  <p>As you can see in the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James and then overridden to be David. In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.</p>
  <p>A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. If you were to replace var with let in the variable declarations of the code above, the result would be an error.</p>
  <code>
    let camper = 'James';
    let camper = 'David';
  </code>
  <p>
    This error can be seen in the console of your browser. So unlike var, when using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once. Note the "use strict". This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions
  </p>
  <p>For instance:</p>
  <code>
  "use strict";
   x = 3.14;
  </code>
  <p>This will display an error that <span>x is not defined.</span></p>
  <p>CHALLENGE:Update the code so it only uses the <span>let</span> keyword.</p>
  <code>
    let catName;
    let quote;
    function catTalk() 
    {
   "use strict";
    catName = "Oliver";
    quote = catName + " says Meow!";
    console.log(quote);
   }
    catTalk();
  </code>
  <h2>Compare Scopes of the <span>var</span> and <span>let</span> Keywords</h2>
  <p>When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.</p>
  <p>The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.</p>
  <p>For Example:</p>
  <code>
  var numArray = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
  {
      numArray.push(i);
  }
  console.log(numArray);
  console.log(i);
  // Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.
  </code>
  
  <p>With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:</p>
  <code>
    var numArray = [];
    var i;
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
    {
      numArray.push(i);
    }
    console.log(numArray);
    console.log(i);
    // Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3
  </code>
  
  <p>This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.</p>
<code>
  var printNumTwo;
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
  {
  if (i === 2) 
  {
    printNumTwo = function() 
    {
    return i;
    };
  }
 }
console.log(printNumTwo());
// Here the console will display the value 3.
</code>
<p>As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to i was updated and the printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i had when the function was created in the for loop. The let keyword does not follow this behavior:</p>
<code>
let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
{
  if (i === 2) 
  {
    printNumTwo = function() 
    {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
console.log(i);
// Here the console will display the value 2, and an error that i is not defined
</code>
<p>i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISES: Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.</p>
<p>This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable. When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.</p>
<code>
  function checkScope() 
  {
    let i = 'function scope';
    if (true) 
    {
      let i = 'block scope';
      console.log('Block scope i is: ', i);
    }
    console.log('Function scope i is: ', i);
    return i;
  }
  checkScope();
  // Block scope i is:  block scope
  // Function scope i is:  function scope
</code>
<h2>Declare a Read-Only Variable with the <span>const</span>  Keyword</h2>
<p>The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.</p>
<p>const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.</p>
<code>
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
//The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET
</code>
<p>As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with const will throw an error. You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.</p>
<p>Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). In a later challenge you will see an example of a lowercase variable identifier being used for an array.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE: Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.</p>
<code>
  function printManyTimes(str) 
  {
    const SENTENCE = str + " is cool!";
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i+=2) 
    {
      console.log(SENTENCE);
    }
  }
  printManyTimes("freeCodeCamp");
</code>
<h2>Mutate an Array Declared with const</h2>
<p>The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.</p>
<p>Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.
However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.</p>
<code>
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3];
s[2] = 45;
console.log(s);
// s = [1, 2, 3] will result in an error
// The console.log will display the value [5, 6, 45].
</code>
<p>As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignments</p>
<code>
  const s = [5, 7, 2];
  function editInPlace() 
  {
    s[0] = 2;
    s[1] = 5;
    s[2] = 7;
    // Using s = [2, 5, 7] would be invalid
  }
  editInPlace();
</code>
<h2>Prevent Object Mutation</h2>
<p>As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function <span>Object.freeze</span> to prevent data mutation.</p>
<p>Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without an error.</p>
<code>
  let obj = 
  {
    name:"FreeCodeCamp",
    review:"Awesome"
  };
  Object.freeze(obj);
  obj.review = "bad";
  obj.newProp = "Test";
  console.log(obj); 
  // The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors,
  // the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.
</code>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: In this challenge you are going to use <span>object.freeze</span> to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the <span>MATH_CONSTANTS </span>object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.</p>
<code>
  function freezeObj() 
  {
    const MATH_CONSTANTS = 
    {
      PI: 3.14
    };
    Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);
    try {
      MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
    } catch(ex) {
      console.log(ex);
    }
    return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
  }
  const PI = freezeObj();
</code>
<h2>Use <span>Arrow Functions </span>to Write Concise Anonymous Functions</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:</p>
<code>
  const myFunc = function() 
  {
    const myVar = "value";
    return myVar;
  }
</code>
<p>ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:</p>
<code>
  const myFunc = () => 
  {
    const myVar = "value";
    return myVar;
  }
</code>
<p>When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code.</p>
<p>This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:</p>
<code>
  const myFunc = () => "value";
  // This code will still return the string <span>value </span>by default.
</code>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.</p>
<code>
  //Before
  var magic = function() {
    return new Date();
  };
</code>
<code>
  //after
  const magic = () => new Date();
</code>
<h2>Write Arrow Functions with Parameters</h2>
<p>Just like a regular function, you can pass arguments into an arrow function.</p>
<code>
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4);
// doubler(4) would return the value 8.
</code>
<p>If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing the parameter may be omitted.</p>
<code>
  const doubler = item => item * 2;
</code>
<p>It is possible to pass more than one argument into an arrow function.</p>
<code>
const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
multiplier(4, 2);
// multiplier(4, 2) would return the value 8.
</code>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.</p>
<code>
  //before
  var myConcat = function(arr1, arr2) 
  {
    return arr1.concat(arr2);
  };
  console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
</code>
<code>
  //after
  const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);
  console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
  // Output : [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
</code>
<h2>Set Default Parameters for Your Functions</h2>
<p>In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces default parameters for functions.</p>
<p>Check out this code:</p>
<code>
const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;
console.log(greeting("John"));
console.log(greeting());
// The console will display the strings Hello John and Hello Anonymous.
</code>
<p>The default parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified (it is undefined). As you can see in the example above, the parameter name will receive its default value Anonymous when you do not provide a value for the parameter. You can add default values for as many parameters as you want.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Modify the function increment by adding default parameters so that it will add 1 to number if value is not specified.</p>
<code>
// Before 
const increment = (number, value) => number + value;
// After 
const increment = (number, value = 1) => number + value;
console.log(increment(4));
console.log(increment(4,3));
</code>
<h2>Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters</h2>
<p>In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest parameter for function parameters. With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.</p>
<p>Rest parameter example: (...args) and (...n) </p>
<p>Check out this code:</p>
<code>
function howMany(...args) 
{
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
// You have passed 3 arguments.
// You have passed 4 arguments.
</code>
<p>The rest parameter eliminates the need to check the args array and allows us to apply <span>map(), filter() and reduce() </span>on the parameters array.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Modify the function sum using the rest parameter in such a way that the function sum is able to take any number of arguments and return their sum.</p>
<code>
// Before
const sum = (x, y, z) => 
{
const args = [x, y, z];
return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
// After
const sum = (...args) => 
{
 return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b,0);
}
console.log(sum(1,2,3));
console.log(sum(1,2,3,4));
console.log(sum());
</code>
<p>HINT</p>
<code>
const product = (n1, n2, n3) => 
{
 const args = [n1, n2, n3];
 return args.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1);
}
console.log(product(2, 4, 6)); //48
// This can be written as 
const product = (...n) => 
{
  return n.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1);
}
console.log(product(2, 4, 6)); //48
</code>
<h2>Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place</h2>
<p>ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places <span>where multiple parameters or elements are expected</span> .</p>
<p>The ES5 code below uses <span>apply()</span>to compute the maximum value in an array:</p>
<code>
var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr);
// maximus would have a value of 89.
</code>
<p>We had to use <span>Math.max.apply(null, arr) </span>because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.</p>
<code>
const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
// maximus would have a value of 89.
</code>
<p>...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array. However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. The following code will not work:</p>
<code>
  const spreaded = ...arr;
</code>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Copy all contents of arr1 into another array arr2 using the spread operator.</p>
<code>
// Before
const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
let arr2;
arr2 = [];  
console.log(arr2);
//After 
const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
let arr2;
arr2 = [...arr1]; 
console.log(arr2);
</code>
<h2>Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects</h2>
<p>Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.</p>
<p>Consider the following ES5 code:</p>
<code>
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
// name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.
</code>
<p>Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:</p>
<code>
  const { name, age } = user;
</code>
<p>Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.</p>
<p>Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.</p>
<p>You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.</p>
<code>
  // Before
  const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  const today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
  const tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;
  //After
  const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
</code>
<h2>Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects</h2>
<p>Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.</p>
<p>Using the same object from the last example:</p>
<code>const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };</code>
<p>Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:</p>
<code>const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;</code>
<p>You may read it as "get the value of <span>user.name</span> and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on. The value of userName would be the string John Doe, and the value of userAge would be the number 34.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.</p>
<code>
  const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  const {today: highToday, tomorrow: highTomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
</code>
<h2>Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects</h2>
<p>You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure values from nested objects.</p>
<p>Using an object similar to previous examples:</p>
<code>
  const user = {
    johnDoe: { 
      age: 34,
      email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
    }
  };
</code>
<p>Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:</p>
<code>const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;</code>
<p>And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:</p>
<code>const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;</code>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables lowToday and highToday the values of today.low and today.high from the LOCAL_FORECAST object.</p>
<code>
  // Before
  const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
    yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
    today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
    tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
  };
  const lowToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.low;
  const highToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.high;
  // After
  const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
    yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
    today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
    tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
  };
  const {today :{low: lowToday, high: highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;
</code>
<h2>Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays</h2>
<p>ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.</p>
<p>One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.</p>
<p>Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:</p>
<code>
const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b);
// The console will display the values of a and b as 1, 2.
</code>
<p>The variable a is assigned the first value of the array, and b is assigned the second value of the array. We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:</p>
<code>
const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c);
// The console will display the values of a, b, and c as 1, 2, 5.
</code>
<p>CHALLENGE EXERCISE: Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.</p>
